Also, youâ€™ll be able to jump into our Discord community & connect with other learners. It will be a great resource to ask questions and get help from others.

Do note, Kaggle team members and Google Developer Experts will be there periodically, but the room is primarily a peer to peer space. Please follow Kaggleâ€™s community guidelines found here.

ðŸ‘€ Coming up this week
For the rest of the week, youâ€™ll learn the basics of Python, the most important language for data science. You don't need programming experience and can complete the course at your own pace throughout the week.

Youâ€™ll get a daily email from us as a reminder to keep on track. Happy learning and see you tomorrow!
