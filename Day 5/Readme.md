ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn
In Lesson 4 (Lists), youâ€™ll learn how to use Python lists to store ordered collections of values. Lists are incredibly useful when writing code to manage several related variables.

In Lesson 5 (Loops and List Comprehensions), youâ€™ll learn an efficient way to repeatedly execute code. With list comprehensions, youâ€™ll often be able to condense code that would have taken several lines to just a single line!
