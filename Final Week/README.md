‚úèÔ∏è Important Notes
Competition

It‚Äôs not too late to get started, if you have not already. This guide has all of the orientation you need.

You can make really strong progress by doing just a little bit each day: aim to submit to the competition at least once each day. Remember you can chat with other participants in the Discussion tab, and you can view code examples from the Kaggle community in the Code tab.

Google Developer Expert Workshops

The workshops are optional for the 30 Days of ML program. There are 3 available: Intro to Supervised Classification, How to Build a Data Science Portfolio and Scikit-optimize for LightGBM.

If you have any questions, there is a Question and Answer channel for each workshop in the 30 Days of ML Discord server. Note: the speakers may not be able to get to every question. If you are able to answer a question, feel free to jump in to help others.

You‚Äôll get another email from us soon before the competition closes, with details for making sure that your best submissions are recorded. Until then, keep up the good work!

Happy learning,
Alexis
