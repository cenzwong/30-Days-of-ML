Hi Kaggler,

Welcome to Week 3 of the program!

For the next two weeks, youâ€™ll be working on a beginner-friendly competition open only to people who have signed up for 30 Days of ML. The top ten teams will receive swag as prizes.

ðŸ“‹ Todayâ€™s Assignment
Get started with the competition.
This is your personal invitation link to join the competition. Please do not share it with anyone else, and do not post it in the Discord community.

ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn
In the link above, youâ€™ll find a detailed introduction to Kaggle competitions (that covers how to work in a team and much more), along with a getting started tutorial that walks you through how to make your very first submission.

For the next two weeks, keep working on the competition! You wonâ€™t receive daily assignments or emails. Try to make at least one submission each day.

If you haven't finished the coursework yet, it's not too late to catch up. For help, be sure to check out 4x Kaggle Grandmaster Abhishek Thakur's video tutorials covering our past assignments (playlist found here).

Happy learning,
Alexis
